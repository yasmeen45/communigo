# Communigo 
### *Connecting Communities Through Movement*

Communigo is created for individuals looking to connect with their communities and become more active. It allows users
to create and join various group activities within a certain area. 

This application is of interest to me because I have been working on becoming more active. 
However, whenever I'm looking to go on a hike or run, I'm never able to find a group of people 
interested in joining me, so I end up losing the motivation to go. Therefore, I'd like to create Communigo
to solve this issue and foster communities that support active lifestyles.
